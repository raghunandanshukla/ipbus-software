    Experimental!! Helper struct for adding the DerivedNode to the Node Factory
    Declaring an instance of an object at global scope means that it is created *before* the main code is entered
    We can use this to our advantage by using the constructor of this object to add entries to the factory in a distributed fashion
    (for instance, in the file where the derived node is defined), rather than manually having to add entries in one file
    To make things even simpler, the REGISTER macro expands the template argument to a string and passes it to the constructor.
